# Dice-Game
In this dice game, the number of players is determined by the outcome of rolling a single die. Here's a concise description:

Odd Number (1, 3, 5): If the dice roll results in an odd number, the game is played with 3 players.

Even Number (2, 4, 6): If the dice roll results in an even number, the game is played with 4 players.

This setup adds an element of unpredictability, as the dice roll determines the group composition before the game begins. Itâ€™s a simple, fun way to switch up the dynamics!
